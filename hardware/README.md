All Pi are powered by an official POE hat except the Master which use a Waveshare one with USB to power the fan.
The main problem was with the case which is clearly overpriced and non-compliant since it cannot be used directly. I had to file down all holes to allow the Pi holder to fit. I also wanted to reverse all RJ45 port so i had to file holes for the screws too. The original fans were also very noisy, so I changed them with two noctua. I am still waiting for microSd card support ..

Networking is very important for this project so i choose to add a failover WAN using a 4G LTE USB dongle to the master (the only pi connected to Internet).
